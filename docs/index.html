            <p>Boulder Running Company, Castle Rock Chamber and Stridemob have joined forces in the effort to bring you the Zackari Parrish 5k Run/Walk #BacktheBlue on Saturday, February 3rd at the Douglas County Events Center.  The race will coincide with the Castle Rock Chamber&#39;s Douglas County Lifestyle Expo. </p>

The Parrish Family as well as the Fallen Officers fund are beneficiaries of the 5k.  Following the race, runners can enjoy a pancake breakfast prior to entering the Douglas County Lifestyle Expo (where the awards ceremony will be held) they can enjoy vendor booths and ongoing entertainment.<br><br>
Bring your spectators, the expo is free and open to public and will include a kid&#39;s obstacle course, interactive displays and more.  To learn more details about the 5k race and to register visit:<br>
